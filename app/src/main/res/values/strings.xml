    <string name="text_help">The benefits of using an ND filter to reduce your depth of field are well known. On bright days, depending on your artistic intent ND filters are almost a necessity. However, the other main advantage of using an ND filter is for long exposures. For example if you want to blur the motion of water or clouds to give a nice smooth effect or make moving objects such as people or cars invisible in an image where your image for example is a busy street and you want to capture the motion yet not the clutter. This trick is also quite useful when you want to capture busy tourist locations. The use of ND filters in this case can make a normally busy and chaotic scene look somewhat surreal.\n</string>
	<string name="text_help2"> .This app will help you to calculate the correct exposure time when taking such photos. Shoot with the camera in manual (M) mode and set a desired aperture. First use the in-camera metering to calculate the exposure of the shot without the filter on. Then, enter the values into this tool and set the exposure to the resulting time. Most of the time the camera will have to be in BULB mode to get a long enough exposure time. To set this, a remote with a locking mechanism can be useful or, for Canon cameras, Magic Lantern can be very useful: http://www.magiclantern.fm/</string>
